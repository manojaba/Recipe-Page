## My process
I started building the recipe page by following the layer arrangements from the design file which I used as a markup nesting.Then started styling each section in an order from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid




### What I learned

It was fun writing the markup following the design file.I had inital challenges to match the border and padding of the design.designing a responsive layout was a little tricky and had initial  struggle while styling columns.

### Continued development

I would like to get more practice in resposive layout and positioning elements in different browser widths.
